üá©üá©üá™ German Verb Conjugation Practice App

This is a simple web application built with Streamlit to help you practice conjugating German verbs in the present tense.

The app presents you with an English sentence (e.g., "I am drinking") and the base German verb (e.g., "trinken"). You must then type the full, correctly conjugated German sentence (e.g., "ich trinke"). The app provides instant feedback and tracks your score, allowing you to test your knowledge in a quiz format.

Features

Interactive Quiz: Practice with randomly shuffled questions.

Instant Feedback: See if your answer is correct right away.

Score Tracking: Your final score is displayed at the end of the quiz.

Extensible Content: Easily add new verbs and sentences by editing a simple text file.

Cheat Sheet: A handy popover shows German pronouns and their corresponding present tense verb endings.
